## Beginners Guide for integrating HTML and Javascript
By Devon Walden

This toutorial will be covering builid a small local HTML and combining it with a bit of Javascript.  

This for any one wanting a quick crash course to start out and wanting to know how HTML and JavaScript work together. I know that when I was transitioning from building mainly console applications in Python and C## that it was challenging for me to "break out to integrading the internet".  I stuggled with understanding how they worked together and why on needed the other.

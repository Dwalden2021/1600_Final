## Beginners Guide for integrating HTML and Javascript
By Devon Walden

This tutorial will be covering building a small local HTML page and combining it with a bit of Javascript.  

This for anyone and everyone wanting a quick and basic crash course to start out.  If you are wanting to know how HTML and JavaScript work together. Personally, I know that when I was transitioning from building mainly console applications in Python and C## that it was challenging for me to "break out to integrating with the internet".  I struggled with understanding how HTML and JavaScript tied so closely together and why one needed the other. I hope this tutorial will help you understand the basics of how these two languages work together.

# Setting up Index page

This page will act as your home page, or the first one that loads up when visiting your website. HTML uses open and close tags to layout the page.  The open tag looks like `<` and the close tag looks like `>`.  Each HTML pages has at a minimum of a head tag, title tag and a body tag.   

Here is what the basic HTML page looks like:

#### Basic HTML page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1></h1>
        <p></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lets update the title:
```HTML
<title>My First Page</title>
```

Then the header:
```HTML
<h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
```

Then lately we will add something to the paragraph:
```HTML
<p>Please use the button below:</p>
```

We will create the button in the next section.  The completed code will look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My First Pages</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
        <p>Please use the button below:</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
On the next page we will add a button to the page as well as input boxes.

#Creating your workspace

One of the first things you will need to do is to create a place on your PC that will contain your HTML and JS file. The easiest way to do this is to create a folder on your desktop, you can title it whatever you would like to. In this example, I will call it "HTML_test". 

* Go to your desktop
* Right click on a blank space
* Select "New Folder"
* Name it "HTML_test"
